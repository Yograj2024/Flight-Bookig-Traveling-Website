    <div className="">
        <p>Refund policies and timelines can vary. They are typically outlined on your itinerary or confirmation email from the time of booking. Depending on your specific reservation, a refund may be issued directly to your original payment method, offer airline credit, rewards, or coupons. In some cases, a combination of these options may be available.</p>
        <p>At <span className="font-semibold">www.wispydeals.com</span> ( a service by Almar International Limited ), our aim is to offer a smooth and clear booking process for all our clients. Our Refund & Cancellation Policy sets out the guidelines for handling cancellations, refunds, and changes to bookings for flights, hotels, and other travel services arranged through our platform.</p>
        <h2 className="text-[1.2rem] font-semibold text-gray-700 lg:text-[1.5rem] lg:mt-[40px] mt-[20px] mb-[10px]">PRICING AND CURRENCY</h2>
        <p>The prices for bookings are quoted in United States Dollars  (USD ). They are subject to change depending on availability, demand, and peak travel times, such as holidays. Please note that prices may fluctuate dynamically without prior notice and will be confirmed upon receipt of payment.</p>
        <p>Cancellation policies and fees vary among U.S. airlines in compliance with federal laws and regulations.The Department of Transportation's website provides helpful information regarding refund requirements,such as eligibility for a refund, the process for tickets purchased through a travel agent or online, and the timeline for refunds to be processed by the airline, agent or online agency. Our carriers strive ligible for future credit (depending on the specific airline's policy) which can be used within one year by the same passenger. Additional penalties may apply according to the airline's policy for cancellations beyond this time frame. Some airlines also have non-refundable fares (including thosecancelled within 24 hours). Please review booking terms at the time of reservation.</p>
        <p>If a deposit or partial payment was made, it will be refunded minus any non-refundable fees upon cancellation. To track your refund status, please contact our agent</p>

        <ul list-disc pl-6 >

        <ul>
            <li>Have you made any changes to your booking? If so, the airline, hotel, car rental company, or activity provider may have added additional fees.</li>

                    <li>Refunds typically take up to 24 hours to process.</li>
                    <li>After processing, your bank or payment service (e.g., PayPal) will handle the transaction.</li>

                    <li>It may take longer for the refund to reflect on your credit card statement</li>

        <h2 className="text-[1.2rem] font-semibold text-gray-700 lg:text-[1.5rem] lg:mt-[40px] mt-[20px] mb-[10px]">PAYMENT OPTIONS AT HOTELS</h2>
        <p>When making a reservation at certain hotels, you may have the choice to secure your booking now and settle the payment later upon arrival or departure.

Some hotels may also require a pre-authorization on your credit card or charge an upfront deposit before check-in. For any inquiries or requests for refunds, please contact the hotel directly. Their contact details can be found in your itinerary.</p>
        <p>This feature allows you to secure your rental car without an upfront payment. Upon arrival at the designated location, the designated driver can use a valid credit card to cover the entire cost. Additionally, the rental company will put a hold on your credit card for the deposit amount. Please note that accepted debit/credit cards for reserve now, pay later bookings differ depending on the car rental company. To ensure acceptance of your card, it is recommended to contact them in advance.</p>

        <h2 className="text-[1.2rem] font-semibold text-gray-700 lg:text-[1.5rem] lg:mt-[40px] mt-[20px] mb-[10px]">ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS</h2>
