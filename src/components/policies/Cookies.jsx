          <p className="mt-[20px]"> When visiting websites, cookies are commonly sent to your computer or mobile device in the form of small text files. These cookies may be first-party, delivered by us, or third-party, delivered by our partners or suppliers. Cookies are classified as either session cookies, which track a user's actions during one browsing session and expire upon session end, or persistent cookies, which identify returning users and remain until expiration ( though you can delete them before then ). Various forms of technology, such as tiny graphics (web beacons, gifs, and clear gifs), are discreetly integrated into our websites and emails, each equipped with a distinct identifier. These tools offer valuable insights into page visits and the performance of advertising banners on both our own sites and others. Moreover, we also employ web beacons in our HTML-based emails to track open rates and evaluate the efficacy of different communications, promotions, and marketing efforts. Proximity-based beacons use close-range, unidirectional signals to communicate with your phone's installed apps. They can deliver updates, like travel-related experiences, and present promotions or discounts. These notifications are only sent when you are in the vicinity and have given consent through the designated mobile app. Embedded into a webpage, pixels are minute elements that cannot be seen with the naked eye. They have multiple functions including delivering cookies to your device, streamlining the log-in process, tracking browsing behaviour on our sites, and enabling online advertising. </p>
